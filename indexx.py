Earthquakes occurring at shallow depths with high magnitudes pose the greatest risk to structures.

# New Section: Recommended Pillar Depth for Earthquake-Resistant Structures

st.markdown("""
**Explanation:**  
For earthquake-resistant design, it's essential to have foundations that are deep enough to provide stability during seismic shaking. Based on simplified engineering guidelines (and supported by various studies and building codes), a rule of thumb is:
    
    **Recommended Pillar Depth (m) = (Magnitude - 3) + 2  (for Magnitude â‰¥ 3)**
    
This means that as the earthquake magnitude increases, the recommended minimum embedment depth of the foundation should also increase. For example:
- A magnitude 4 event suggests a minimum depth of ~3 m.
- A magnitude 6 event suggests a minimum depth of ~5 m.
- A magnitude 7 event suggests a minimum depth of ~6 m.
    
These values are illustrative and must be adjusted according to local soil conditions, building requirements, and safety factors.

**Conclusion:**  
This comprehensive analysis of Indonesian earthquake data reveals several key insights:
- **Magnitude Distribution:** The histogram and CDF illustrate the frequency and cumulative probability of different earthquake magnitudes, which is vital for risk assessment.
- **Depth-Magnitude Relationship:** The scatter plot with regression provides insight into how earthquake depth might affect magnitude. Notably, shallow, high-magnitude events (highlighted in our high-risk analysis) are critical for building resilience.
- **Building Resilience:** The additional analysis on recommended pillar depth suggests that as earthquake magnitude increases, deeper foundations (pillars) may be necessary to improve structural stability. Although simplified, this guideline can support preliminary design considerations for earthquake-resistant structures.
- **Temporal Trends:** Time series and rolling average analyses reveal trends and anomalies in seismic activity over time.
- **Spatial Distribution:** The geographic map helps identify regions with high earthquake density, crucial for regional planning and emergency response.
- **Correlation Analysis:** The heatmap confirms the relationship between key variables, supporting further statistical modeling.

**Implications and Applications:**  
- **Risk Mitigation:** Understanding the distribution of earthquake magnitudes and the depth-magnitude relationship can inform risk assessment and emergency preparedness strategies.
- **Urban Planning and Building Codes:** Insights from the recommended pillar depth analysis can guide building code revisions and foundation design, particularly in regions prone to shallow, high-magnitude earthquakes.
- **Engineering Research:** The visualizations provide a basis for more detailed studies on the seismic performance of structures, paving the way for advanced engineering models.
- **Public Policy and Awareness:** Clear visualizations and data-driven insights support educational initiatives and policy decisions aimed at reducing earthquake-related risks.

Overall, this dashboard not only delivers a detailed statistical and probabilistic overview of seismic activity in Indonesia but also offers actionable insights for enhancing building resilience in earthquake-prone areas.
